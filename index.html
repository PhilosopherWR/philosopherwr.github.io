				<p>Award winning fiction writer and poetry performer. <em>"Five Out of Five Hearts" winner of the Switchgrass Review Fiction First Place.</em>
Philly Vasquez is quite literally the most interesting poet in the world. When Philly could not stop for Time Time kindly stopped for her. She recently graduated with a bachelor's in English. The devil once sold his soul for one of her limericks. She has been a panelist at the People's Poetry Festival for the past two years. Her milkshake brings all the sonnets to the yard and her verse is better than Will's. She was the Associate Editor of Fiction for the Windward Review and won first place for fiction in the Switchgrass Review. Quoth The Raven, "Damn Phily got mad rhymes."
