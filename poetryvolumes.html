								And look forward to the debut of Volume 2. From sweet to bitter and bold, Philly Vasquez pours on to the page elusive snapshots of magic in urban realities. Pull back the veil and explore modern woes, answered with spurs of manic jubilation, through surreality like the thick sallow haze of opium. Let comprehension of power, poverty, and loss trickle down the stone slated fountain to be taken up again in an endless pump.
