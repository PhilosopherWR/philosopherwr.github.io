   <h1>This is the first-level, top-level heading</h1>
   <p>This <strong>book would not have</strong> been <em>possible without the great hearts</em> and welcoming
minds of the <b>computers</b> and writing <i>community</i>, many of whom show up
within the text. I wish I could mention everyone who has had an influence on
my thinking, my scholarship, my education, but the scope of a work like this
is necessarily limited. I especially want to thank those innovators who started
Kairos in 1995/96â€”Mick
Doherty, <q>Mike Salvo</q>, Greg Siering, <cite>Elizabeth Pass</cite>,
Corey Wick, Jason Teague, and Amy Hanson. I must also thank Michael Day
for showing me the ropes at my very first academic conference and introducing
me to many of the <a href="http://www.google.com">aforementioned innovators</a>, thus setting me on the
path that eventually lead to my becoming the editor and publisher of Kairos,
which I believe to be one of the most innovative scholarly journals in any field.</p>
