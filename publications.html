						<h2>As a contributing writer</h2>
						<!--Five out of Five blurb-->
            <p>“Five Out of Five Hearts”, winner of the Switchgrass Review first place fiction award. Published in Vol 2 Nov 5, 2015 by the Coastal Bend Wellness Foundation. <a href="http://www.cbwellness.org/switchgrass-review.html" target="_blank">www.cbwellness.org</a>
							<br><img src="a_a_sgr2016.png" alt="Cover of the Switchgrass Review Volume 2" height="225" align="left">"Five out of Five Hearts" follows the post-college years of Linda and Paul, two friends in the LGBTQIA+ community who share a dualism of character, gender identity, and relationship trajectory. Through a series of five vingettes, woven together with the techno-texture of social media and device mediation, we see the fracturing of a friendship that cannot be sustained on the purity of sameness without cross-examination. Readers have called the story a 'romantic' tragedy while I view it as a platonic one, which makes the characters non-the-less tragic or star-crossed. Paul is Linda's alternate life path.<br>

						<!--Penultimate blurb-->
						<br>“Penultimate Myth”, honorable mention at the prestigious Scissortail Poetry Festival. Published in the Island Waves Student Newspaper, Vol 26, Issue 11, Pg 2, 10 April 2014. <a href="https://issuu.com/islandwaves/docs/full_issue_11"target="_blank">Island Waves</a>

						  <br><img src="islandwaves_penultimate.png" alt="Cover of the Island Waves newspaper Volume 26" height="300" align="left">"Penultimate Myth" signified a return to poetry for me, not in the sense that I hadn't written poetry just prior to that, but rather that I reinvented poetry in my life. It was now something I was compelled to share. This poem was written as a letter to someone I had a crush on but it was decidedly not a love poem. Rather, it was because I had such admiration and trust for that person, that communication with them, through this poem, was the pipeline of catharsis that I needed, not only to tap the tumult of my situation, but to compose it into an artwork. This was how I found stability.<br>

						<!--Superstition blurb-->
						<br>“Superstition”, Published in the Island Waves Student Newspaper, Vol 25, Issue 29, Pg 7 October 30, 2014. <a href="https://issuu.com/islandwaves/docs/issue_29" target="_blank">Island Waves</a>
